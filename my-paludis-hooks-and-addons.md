Short Intro
-----------

In my [paludis-hooks](https://github.com/zaufi/paludis-hooks) repo I'm trying to accumulate everything 
I've done to <del>survive w/</del> for [paludis](http://paludis.exherbo.org) -- The Other Package Manager.
Yep, initially there was only [hooks](http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/hooks.html), but later I've
added some other helpful things I'm using for awhile... so probably the repo should be renamed.

Personally I like hooks, cuz that facility, out of the box, turns paludis into a really flexible package manager
and thanks to them, feature like _autopatch_ works much more better (and reliably) than the
[same feature](https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=3&chap=6#doc_chap6) of 
`emerge` became available long time after.

To install all that stuff here is a 
[ebuild](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/blob/master/sys-apps/paludis-hooks/paludis-hooks-scm.ebuild)
in my overlay. And yes, that `scm` is the only version ;-) cuz I'm permanently doing some improvements...

**NOTE**: To use it w/ Python 3 as a default interpreter make sure you have an 
[appropriate](/gentoo/2013/12/11/paludis-python3/) paludis version installed.


Things in Details
=================

Autopatch Hook
--------------

One of my first hooks inspired by already dead repo of paludis' hooks I've found soon after migrated to
paludis. That was one from a bunch of reasons to forget about `emerge` -- a really easy way to apply my patches
for broken packages w/o "writing" a my own ebuild and put it to my repo. 

The idea is simple and straightforward: at any desired stage of ebuild processing apply some _user provided patches_
placed into a some special place (configurable via `/etc/paludis/hooks/configs/auto-patch.conf`).

To apply a patch one have to put it into a directory under `${PATCH_DIR}/stage/category/pkg-spec-with-ver/`,
where the `stage` is one of the following: `ebuild_compile_post`, `ebuild_compile_pre`,
`ebuild_configure_post`, `ebuild_configure_pre`, `ebuild_install_pre` or `ebuild_unpack_post`.

Recently I've killed all out of date patches from my local vault and made it 
[public](https://github.com/zaufi/paludis-autopatches). For example w/o a patch `cmake` wont colorize its
output even if color explicitly requested when running w/ captured output. So to allow my 
[Pluggable Output Processor](/pluggable-output-processor.html) works w/ suppressing colors of CMake I have 
`/var/db/paludis/autopatches/ebuild_unpack_post/dev-utils/cmake-2.8.11.2/cmake-2.8.11.2-do-not-check-isatty.patch`


Filesystem Hook
---------------

This plugin can be used to make some manipulations in a package's image, right after `make install`
and before it will be actually merged into the system. Particularly I use it to make a _permanent_
symlinks to a documentation for some packages I use in my work or to prevent undesired files to be installed.

Every action required to take place described in terms of XML items of configuration file
`/etc/paludis/hooks/configs/filesystem-manager.conf`, where the root element is `commands`.
A commands container consists of `package` elements which must have at least `spec` attribute of a package 
to apply actions for. The other attributes are `stop` with boolean `true`/`false` value to disable/enable
further processing if given rule matched, and `descr` attribute with human readable actions description.
The package's `spec` attribute specify the order how actions are matched and applied:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>priority</th> <th>spec</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>16</td> <td>cat/package-ver-rv:slot::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15</td> <td>cat/package-ver-rv:slot</td></tr>
                <tr><td>14</td> <td>cat/package-ver-rv::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13</td> <td>cat/package-ver-rv</td></tr>
                <tr><td>12</td> <td>cat/package:slot::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>11</td> <td>cat/package:slot</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10</td> <td>cat/package::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>9</td>  <td>cat/package</td></tr>
                <tr><td /> <td/></tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>priority</th> <th>spec</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>8</td> <td>package-ver-rv:slot::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>7</td> <td>package-ver-rv:slot</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td> <td>package-ver-rv:repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td> <td>package-ver-rv</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td> <td>package:slot::repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td> <td>package:slot</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td> <td>package:repo</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td> <td>cat/*</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td> <td>*/*</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

There are few children tags possible under the `package` element:

* `symlink` -- used to create a symlink and has attributes:
    * `cd` -- change to this directory before making a symlink
    * `src` -- source for the symlink
    * `dst` -- destination of the symlink
* `rm` -- used to remove something from the image, so it will not be installed at all.
    * `dst` -- what to remove
    * `reverse` -- optional attribute to specify that command should remove **everything** except
      selected target(s)

Paths in a rule may refer to shell variables like `P`, `PN`, `PF`, `PV`, `PVR` and everything else
declared by [PMS](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:PMS).
Note that all absolute paths are refer to the package's image directory and not to the "real" filesystem.

### Examples

#### Make permanent symlinks to documentation

This was an initial motivation to write this hook: I use firefox to view documentation to various packages.
Documentation for `=dev-lib/boost-1.54`, for example, will be installed to `/usr/share/doc/boost-1.54`.
Firefox will remember that location and next time will show me a some hint of most visited pages, when I
type something in a location bar. Unfortunately after upgrade to `=dev-libs/boost-1.55-r1` path to documentation
obviously will be changed and that hits from firefox will not work without fixing. The second problem with that:
I have to remember exact package version with ebuild revision and should type it in a location bar a long time
until firefox realized that visits count of some `1.55-r1` page is greater than same but with `1.54` in the path
and will offer it instead.

The solution is to make a "permanent" symbolic link which will stay the same for any version installed. 
Moreover it can be a little shorter :-) So instead of `/usr/share/doc/boost-1.55.0-r1/html/index.html` I have 
`/usr/share/doc/boost/index.html` as a hint in a location bar and don't care about particular version installed.

To achieve that I've added a simple rule to my config:
{% highlight xml %}
    <package spec="dev-libs/boost">
        <symlink cd="/usr/share/doc" src="${PF}/html" dst="${PN}" />
    </package>
{% endhighlight %}
So, this rule will change current directory to `/usr/share/doc` inside an image directory and create
a symbolic link `boost` pointing to `boost-1.55-r1/html/`.


#### Remove unused translations/locales

I have `*/* -nls` in my `/etc/paludis/use.conf`, but some packages just don't have that USE flag,
but install localizations anyway (yep, cuz ebuild authors just lazy ppl... most of the time).
So `app-admin/localpurge` was "invented" to cleanup unused locales (ALL in my case). But `localepurge`
will remove `*.mo` files after install, so when uninstall a package, some files will be marked as _gone_.
One simple rule will do the job better:
{% highlight xml %}
    <package spec="*/*" descr="locale-cleaner">
        <rm cd="/usr/share/locale/" dst="*/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo" />
    </package>
{% endhighlight %}
Because manipulations (deleting `*.mo` files) will be done **before** install, all that files even
won't be counted by package manager. And I'm not telling about that you don't need to run any tool periodically
(or via cron) -- all your packages will be already clean w/o any manual actions :)

Translations is a part of the "problem": some packages (like `alsa-utils`) want to install translated manual pages
as well. To remove them (everything except English) one may use the following rule:
{% highlight xml %}
    <package spec="*/*" descr="man-pages-cleaner">
        <rm cd="/usr/share/man/" dst="man{0p,1,1p,2,3,3p,4,5,6,7,8}" reverse="true" />
    </package>
{% endhighlight %}
Note attribute `reverse` tells to the hook that everything except specified items (directories actually)
should be removed.

Other usage examples can be found 
[here](https://github.com/zaufi/paludis-config/blob/master/hooks/configs/filesystem-manager.conf).


Manage Build Environments
-------------------------

This feature is not a hook actually, but some addon to be used from `/etc/paludis/bashrc`.
It allows to manage compiler flags (as well as any other environments variables) on a per package basis
like it possible in portage via [`package.env` file](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/env).

To use it, one have to add the following to `/etc/paludis/bashrc` somewhere after `CFLAGS` and other definitions.

{% highlight bash %}
[ -e /usr/libexec/paludis-hooks/setup_pkg_env.bash ] && . /usr/libexec/paludis-hooks/setup_pkg_env.bash
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can edit `/etc/paludis/package_env.conf` to specify how environment should be changed to compile
any particular package. For example I have it like this:


    #
    # My per package environment settings
    #

    sys-devel/binutils binutils-extras

    dev-lang/python extra-optimize
    dev-db/sqlite extra-optimize
    sys-apps/paludis extra-optimize

    sys-libs/db use-bfd-linker

    app-emulation/virtualbox no-gc-sections use-bfd-linker
    media-libs/alsa-lib no-gc-sections
    sys-devel/glibc no-gc-sections
    x11-libs/cairo no-gc-sections

    net-libs/webkit-gtk no-debug
    www-client/firefox no-debug


Every line has a package spec and a space separated list of environment modifiers. Every modifier actually
is a file from `/etc/paludis/env.conf.d`. In that file (an ordinal bash script actually) defined some actions to 
modify `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` or anything else you want. There are two helpful functions `add-options` 
and `remove-options` to add/remove some options to/from some variable. For example I have the following
`LDFLAGS` definition in my `bashrc`:

{% highlight bash %}
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, not all packages like `--gc-sections` option. For example `app-emulation/virtualbox`, it is why
it mentioned in my `package_env.conf`. So here is mine `/etc/paludis/env.conf.d/no-gc-sections.conf`:

{% highlight bash %}
einfo "Remove --gc-sections from linker flags"
remove-options LDFLAGS -Wl,--gc-sections
{% endhighlight %}

Yes, you can use logging functions as well ;-) The last command will remove undesired option from default 
("global") `LDFLAGS`. Unfortunately `app-emulation/virtualbox` also fails to build if default linker is `ld.gold`.
It is why its entry has two modifiers in `package_env.conf`. The second one 
`/etc/paludis/env.conf.d/use-bfd-linker.conf` will tell to use `ld.bfd` to link that package:

{% highlight bash %}
einfo "Use ld.bfd linker"
add-options LDFLAGS -fuse-ld=bfd
{% endhighlight %}

and it use `add-option` helper function to update `LDFLAGS`. Being an _ordinal bash script_ one may use any
other programs, `sed` for example, to modify environment and/or build flags for particular package.


New `cave` Command
------------------

This package also add a "new" command `cave print-ebuild-path <spec>` which just prints a full path to the
ebuild according a given `spec`.

    zaufi@gentop〉~〉 cave print-ebuild-path firefox
    /usr/portage/www-client/firefox/firefox-26.0.ebuild

    zaufi@gentop〉~〉 cave print-ebuild-path '<www-client/firefox-26.0'
    /usr/portage/www-client/firefox/firefox-24.2.0.ebuild

    zaufi@gentop〉~〉 cave print-ebuild-path paludis-hooks
    /var/db/paludis/repositories/zaufi-overlay/sys-apps/paludis-hooks/paludis-hooks-scm.ebuild

This command (mostly) introduced for further scripts.


Short Aliases and Some Other Helpers
------------------------------------

I use the following short aliases for `cave` commands:

{% highlight bash %}
alias cs='cave search --index ${CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX}'
alias cm='cave manage-search-index --create ${CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX}'
alias cc='cave contents'
alias cr='cave resolve'
alias crz='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT}'
alias cw='cave show'
alias co='cave owner'
alias cu='cave uninstall'
alias cy='cave sync'
alias cz='cave resume -Cs ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT}'
alias world-up='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT} -c -km -Km -Cs -P "*/*" -Si -Rn world'
alias system-up='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT} -c -km -Km -Cs -P "*/*" -Si -Rn system'
{% endhighlight %}

Variables `CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX` and `CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT` are defined in `/etc/env.d/90cave` file.
Also here some trick used to reintroduce bash completions for all that commands, so even if alias is used
completions are still available.

Note that `-km` and `-Km` [options are used](/gentoo/2013/12/21/gpotw-5/). So when gentoo team adds some changes
to ebuild w/o version bump, that options will add a target to rebuild. To show differences between ebuilds of
installed package and just changed (and added as a target to rebuild on `world-up` "command") one may use
`pkg-meta-diff <pkg-name>` command.

To show differences between ebuilds of installed and the next best available version use `pkg-next-diff <pkg-name>`.

TODO
====

* add some `USE` flags to `paludis-hooks` 
  [ebuild](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/blob/master/sys-apps/paludis-hooks/paludis-hooks-scm.ebuild)
  to be able to choose what components to install...
