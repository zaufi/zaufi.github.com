Changes since release 1.0.2:

* Simple preprocessor directive auto completion has been added. If there is no ambiguity it will
auto substitute an item. E.g. to type `#pragma` it would be enough to press `#` and `p`.
It is replacement for former `#in` "shortcut" to type `#include`â€¦  

![Preprocessor and #include completer][p1]

* Improved `#include` completion with better support for local (project) files. Some other
features (like _Open Header/Implementation_) was also improved to support local headers.  

![Toggle #include style][p2]

* Introduced an action to toggle `#include` style -- i.e. between `<>` and `""` form.
It is easy to transform a bunch of `#include`s using a shortcut (default <kbd>Alt+#</kbd>).  

![Toggle #include style action][p3]

* And as usual, also here is a bunch of refactorings to make a code better (thanks to C++14 ;-).

i.e. GCC >= 4.9 or Clang >= 3.5.
