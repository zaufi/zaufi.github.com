-----------------------------

I've set my default compiler to GCC 5.1… This week end I decided to rebuild my `installed-packaes` w/ it.
And, as expected, I'v faced w/ a bunch of problems.

[Here][1] is a one of them:
GCC 5.x has reviewed `-pedantic` policy, so `libssh` wont compile anymore.

    In file included from net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/src/agent.c:53:0:
    net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/src/agent.c: In function 'ssh_set_agent_channel':
    net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/include/libssh/priv.h:200:33: error: ISO C does not support '__FUNCTION__' predefined identifier [-Wpedantic]
         _ssh_set_error(error, code, __FUNCTION__, __VA_ARGS__)

I've made an [auto-patch][2] (in my repo) to remove that flags and a [bug][3] to Gentoo's bugzilla… hope it wouldn't be
another one wasting of my time.

Another issue was `x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel` -- because of [gcc bug][4]. Setting [per package options][5] for that package
w/ adding `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0` works as a workaround.

The next problem happened w/ `x11-base/xorg-server`: [here][6] is a bug in Gentoo's bugzilla, and [here][7] is an explanation of the reason
(in section <<Preprocessor issues>>).
I've just copied the [patch][8] from the bug to my [repo][9] of auto-patches to solve this issue.
