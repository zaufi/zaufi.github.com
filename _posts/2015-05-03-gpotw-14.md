-----------------------------

I've set my default compiler to GCC 5.1… This week end I decided to rebuild my `installed-packaes` w/ it.
And, as expected, I'v faced w/ a bunch of problems.

[Here](1) is a one of them:
GCC 5.x has reviewed `-pedantic` policy, so `libssh` wont compile anymore.

    In file included from net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/src/agent.c:53:0:
    net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/src/agent.c: In function 'ssh_set_agent_channel':
    net-libs-libssh-0.6.4/work/libssh-0.6.4/include/libssh/priv.h:200:33: error: ISO C does not support '__FUNCTION__' predefined identifier [-Wpedantic]
         _ssh_set_error(error, code, __FUNCTION__, __VA_ARGS__)

I've made an [auto-patch](2) (in my repo) to remove that flags and a [bug](3) to Gentoo's bugzilla… hope it wouldn't be
another one wasting of my time.
