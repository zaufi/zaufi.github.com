----------------------------

Recently I had an interesting discussion w/ paludis developers and learn few tricks from it.
Now my aliases (defined in `/etc/profile.d/cave-aliases.sh`) look like this:

    CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX=/var/cache/paludis/csi.idx
    CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT='--resume-file /storage/tmp/paludis/resume'

    alias cs='cave search --index ${CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX}'
    alias cm='cave manage-search-index --create ${CAVE_SEARCH_INDEX}'
    alias cc='cave contents'
    alias cr='cave resolve'
    alias crz='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT}'
    alias cz='cave resume -Cs ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT}'
    alias cw='cave show'
    alias co='cave owner'
    alias cu='cave uninstall'
    alias cy='cave sync'
    alias world-up='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT} -c -km -Km -Cs -P "*/*" -Si -Rn world'
    alias system-up='cave resolve ${CAVE_RESUME_FILE_OPT} -c -km -Km -Cs -P "*/*" -Si -Rn system'

Note `-km -Km` options. They are needed to rebuild packages modified w/o version/revision bump
-- the bad practice used widely by gentoo team (unfortunately). Next time I had run `world-up`, I got 389 packages
to reinstall ;-)


* __problem__: `=dev-libs/libev-4.15` fail to configure (see bug [#494924](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494924))   
  __solution__: While it is not resolved  I use the 
  [ebuild](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/blob/master/dev-libs/libev/libev-4.15-r1.ebuild) from my overlay.

* __problem__: `=media-gfx/exiv2-0.23` wont install doxygened documentation w/ `USE=doc` (see bug [#494920](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494920))   
  __solution__: Here is improved
  [ebuild](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/blob/master/media-gfx/exiv2/exiv2-0.23-r3.ebuild) from my overlay:
  it address the problem w/ docs installation and adds support for Python 3 to that package. It needed to
  regenerate some HTML templates when build docs.

* __problem__: there was a dependency (blocker to be precise) problem w/ `paludis` for `kdepimlibs-4.12`   
  __solution__: it was partly solved w/ adding a lot of options like `--avoid` and `--favour` 
  (thanks to _albel727_ from `#paludis` channel), but better solution is to hack the 
  [ebuild](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/blob/master/kde-base/kdepimlibs/kdepimlibs-4.12.0-r1.ebuild)   
  __note__: the "official" ebuild was updated in the portage tree today (Dec, 21)... yep, w/o version bump again!
  ... and I'm lazy to check if it really fixed (don't want to downgrade from my `4.12-r1` revision)
