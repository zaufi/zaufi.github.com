----------------------------

Some time ago `cairo` gets updated and it was failed to build around a two weeks annoying me
all the time I'm doing world update. It was failed to link complaining about some missed symbols that
obviously being here (i.e. defined by the library itself). Looking to gentoo's bugzill I've found nothing
interesting, but some uncertain talks about clang+LTO (but nowadays I have gcc 4.9 as default compiler).
Fortunately I've noticed `USE=lto`, for that package turned ON by default, and removing it solve the link failure.


* __problem__: `=x11-libs/cairo-1.2.16` fail to build (link to be exact)  
__solution__: disable `lto` use-flag
