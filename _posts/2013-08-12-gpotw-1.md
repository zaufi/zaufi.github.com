I've being asked to write short notes about the ways I've solved problems with updating the __World__.
So here is an issue #1 :) (it would be a list of issues actually ;-)

Like a famous _Guru Of The Week_ this series will be named _Gentoo Problem Of The Week_ ;-)

----------------------------


* __problem__: no more `virtual/init` in the portage tree!  
  __solution__: reinstall `openrc`: `cave resolve openrc -P virtual/init`

* __problem__: two blocks when updating to TeX live 2013 -- there is no more packages for
  `dev-texlive/texlive-documentation-base` and  `dev-texlive/texlive-texinfo`.  
  __solution__: just uninstall 'em w/ `--uninstalls-may-break`, then `cave -n virtual/texi2dvi`
  (must be reinstalled cuz ebuild in the tree has been changed w/o revision incrase), then
  continue to update the World.

* __problem__: block w/ `dev-python/pyparsing`  
  __solution__: recent version of `virtual/pyparsing-3` needs only `>=dev-python/pyparsing-2.0.1:0`
  instead of two versions (installed into different slots `py2` and `py3`). Just remove older `pyparsing`
  packages w/ `--uninstalls-may-break` -- latest version will be installed on World update.
