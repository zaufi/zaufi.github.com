----------------------------


* __problem__: `PyQt4-4.10.3`, updated this week, require `sip` version 4.15.x, but latter can't be
  updated due slot dependency from `pykde4` (and installed `PyQt4-4.10.2`)  
  __solution__: reinstall `sip`, `PyQt4` and `pykde4` at one shot. But, due a 
  [bug #323899](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=323899) I have to switch back to **my** `9999` version
  of `pykde4` (it already fixed in git repo). Ebuild for it can be found in [my repository](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay)
  and it doesn't require all depended KDE ebuilds to be `9999`...
