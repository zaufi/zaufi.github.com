Ok, lets go!

First of all u have to emerge a `debootstrap` package, then become root and do the following:

    root@gentop ~ $ cd /storage/schroot/
    root@gentop /storage/schroot $ debootstrap oneiric oneiric.schroot
    I: Retrieving InRelease
    I: Failed to retrieve InRelease
    I: Retrieving Release
    W: Cannot check Release signature; keyring file not available /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg
    I: Retrieving Packages
    I: Validating Packages
    I: Resolving dependencies of required packages...
    I: Resolving dependencies of base packages...
    I: Checking component main on http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu...
    <...skipped...>

This command will prepare base environment for Ubuntu 11.10 (to make same for 12.04 just replace
`oneiric` to `precise`). The `/storage/schroot/` is a base directory where I keep all my chroot'ed systems.

Next step is to install `schroot` and write a config files for it (`/etc/schroot/schroot.conf`):

    [oneiric]
    type=directory
    description=Ubuntu Oneiric 11.10
    directory=/storage/schroot/oneiric.schroot
    users=build
    groups=users
    root-groups=root,wheel
    script-config=ubuntu/config

The last line points to a config file relative to `/etc/schroot` w/ the following content:

    # Filesystems to mount inside the chroot.
    FSTAB="/etc/schroot/ubuntu/fstab"

    # Files to copy from the host system into the chroot.
    COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/ubuntu/copyfiles"

    # System NSS databases to copy into the chroot.
    NSSDATABASES="/etc/schroot/ubuntu/nssdatabases"

The most intersting here is a `fstab`:

    /proc     /proc     none    rw,bind     0   0
    /sys      /sys      none    rw,bind     0   0
    /dev      /dev      none    rw,bind     0   0
    /dev/pts  /dev/pts  none    rw,bind     0   0
    /tmp      /tmp      none    rw,bind     0   0
    /home     /home     none    rw,bind     0   0
    /storage/soft/ubuntu/archives   /var/cache/apt/archives none    rw,bind     0   0

Other files could be taken from default configuration (`/etc/schroot/default`).
Also it would be nice to have the following function in a `~/.bashrc`:

{% highlight bash %}
function build-chroot()
{
    cd /home/builder
    select c in `/usr/bin/schroot -l`; do
        /usr/bin/schroot -c $c -u builder
        break
    done
}
{% endhighlight %}

so u may just run it from the bash prompt to switch into a chroot'ed environment of your choice
(as user _builder_, so do not forget to add such user or use some other name).

*NOTE* While update packages in a chrooted system install scripts sometimes may fail because theres
no `upstart` running. To solve this trouble one may symlink `/sbin/initctl` to `/bin/true`

Minimal Ubuntu install do not have `en_US.UTF-8` (I dunno why! Or maybe I'm doing smth wrong), so
it myst be generated (if your host locale is UTF as in example):

    (saucy)root@gentop:/home/builder# locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
    Generating locales...
    en_US.ISO-8859-1... done
    en_US.UTF-8... done
    Generation complete.

To prepare a build "work horse" install the following packages as (chrooted) root:

    # apt-get install build-essential devscripts doxygen cmake software-properties-common pkg-config

Then add some PPAs:

    (saucy)root@gentop:/home/builder# add-apt-repository ppa:boost-latest
    You are about to add the following PPA to your system:
    Providing the most up-to-date version of the Boost C++ Libraries.
    More info: https://launchpad.net/~boost-latest/+archive/ppa
    Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it

    gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpi67dku/secring.gpg' created
    gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpi67dku/pubring.gpg' created
    gpg: requesting key 029DB5C7 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com

    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
    OK

Also consider to add `ppa:likemartinma/devel` for fresh CMake. Now update packages and install boost librariesâ€¦
