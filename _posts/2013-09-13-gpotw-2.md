----------------------------


* __problem__: ruby 2.0 wants to be installed (despite of `RUBY_TARGETS` do not mention it)  
  __solution__: see bug [483254](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483254)... in brief
  the problem is: gentoo support team wants to have ruby 2.0 (cuz it stable and recommended by upstream),
  but too lazy to mark all remain ebuilds to have it in `RUBY_TARGETS`, so they just decide to
  __force__ this USE-expand flag in portage profiles! (damn!) Personally I satisfied w/ ruby 1.9 
  (cuz use just few ruby packages) and don't want to install a new version (everything what I need
  works already fine for me). To "unforce" it I've started to maintain my own
  [profile](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/tree/master/profiles) 
  (in my [repository](https://github.com/zaufi/zaufi-overlay/tree/master)). Thanks to `paludis`
  where it is possible to have (apply) multiple profiles for particular installation.  
  To add it, one have to append a full path to my profile dir into the `/etc/paludis/repositories/gentoo.conf`
  (yep, my repo must be configured as well):  

        profiles = ${location}/profiles/default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde ${root}/var/db/paludis/repositories/zaufi-overlay/profiles/base


* __problem__: no suitable version of `virtual/pyparsing`  
  __solution__: according changelog entry it doesn't required anymore. Just reinstall all depended
  packages (ebuilds are fixed in the portage tree already, and as usual w/o revision increment)
