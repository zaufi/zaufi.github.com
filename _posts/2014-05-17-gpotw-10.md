----------------------------

Since a long time ago I knew that `x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev` and `x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics`
have smth broken in ebuilds (eclass actually), so they are trying to write smth into `/usr/src/linux/`
while checking my kernel configuration (!!!). Last week that packages got a version bump and I've faced
w/ sandbox violation problem again (and yes, I've forget what did I do to install that packaes last time).

    xf86-input-synaptics-1.7.6>  * Determining the location of the kernel source code
    xf86-input-synaptics-1.7.6>  * Found kernel source directory:
    xf86-input-synaptics-1.7.6>  *     /usr/src/linux
     * ACCESS DENIED:  open_wr:      /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27231.tmp
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27231.tmp
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27231.o
     * ACCESS DENIED:  open_wr:      /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27236.tmp
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27236.tmp
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27236.o
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27245.tmp
     * ACCESS DENIED:  unlinkat:     /usr/src/linux-3.14.4-gentoo/.27245.o

The reason for that is `getfilevar()` of `linux-info.eclass` which tries to get some kernel
settings using `make <smth>`...

I don't want to fix that eclass, so a simplest way to workaround the problem is to add `/usr/src/linux/`
to the list of write permitted directories of the sandbox.
To do so, I've added the `/etc/paludis/env.conf.d/allow_kernel_src_write.conf`, with the following content:

{% highlight bash %}
SANDBOX_WRITE=${SANDBOX_WRITE}:/usr/src/linux
{% endhighlight %}

And the following two lines to my `/etc/paludis/package_env.conf`:

    x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics allow_kernel_src_write
    x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev allow_kernel_src_write
