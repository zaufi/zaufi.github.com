**Attention** gentoo/C++ developers who use boost library!
Starting from ``=dev-libs/boost-1.50.0-r2`` there is no more ``eselect`` profiles! So, no way to switch
between few versions of boost! And no way to easy (lazy :) detect it from your configure scripts (only hard way :).

Tiziano MÃ¼ller, the author of ``=dev-libs/boost-1.50-r2`` ebuild, which is recently (silently) appears
in a portage tree kindly gave me some explanations about future directions according boost and eselect:

    Yes, that change is intentional.
    I know that this makes the live for people using Gentoo as development
    platform harder, but unfortunately this is how we have to proceed.

    See my announcement on the gentoo-dev ml here:
    http://marc.info/?l=gentoo-dev&m=134580187015362&w=1

    and an earlier discussion here:
    http://marc.info/?l=gentoo-dev&m=132704075103126&w=1

    I'll do an official announcement on gentoo-dev-announce (and maybe a news item)
    at least when it hits stable (possibly already if it gets unmasked).

So we (C++ developers) have to do smth w/ this, cuz live getting harder %)
Personally I use a [paludis hook](https://bitbucket.org/zaufi/paludis-hooks/src/d0917595ba8d/symlinks-maintainer)
to make auxilary symlinks during package install. So it was enough to add a bunch of ``symlink`` elements
to a configuration XML file (using command pipe with ``ls`` and ``sed``)...

Fortunately cmake (my primary build system) has good enough boost detection support, but some packages
in my system got broken :( and I have no time to fix 'em. Particularly [schroot](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432790)
has broken and unable to detect boost anymore... and to fix it ``configure.ac`` needs sane boost
detection (yep, nowadays it is simple and naive... u even unable to specify alternative location for it).
