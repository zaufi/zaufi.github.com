## What is this place about?

Here is my notepad (I actually hate blogs) about <strike>hard</strike> life under the Gentoo Linux :)

I'll try to collect a some kind of knowledge base [here](archive.html), based on my Gentoo experience.
...cuz I've started to forget some tricks while fixing smth.

Also I'm going to try to add more pages about <del>some of</del> all my open source projects ;-) ... 
sometimes, some day ;-)
