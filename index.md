## What is this place about?

Here is my notepad about the <del>hard</del> life under the Gentoo Linux :) After some time, I have to admit
that this place is turned into a <del>stupid</del> blog.

I'll try to collect some kind of knowledge base [here](archive.html), based on my Gentoo experience
...cuz I've started to forget some tricks while fixing smth.

Also I'm going to <del>try to</del> add more pages about <del>some of</del> all my open source projects ;-) ... 
sometimes, some day ;-)

Here is [my CV](assets/AlexTurbov.pdf) for potential employers ;-)

And [here](rss-kde.xml) is a link to KDE related RSS <del>for bots</del>.
